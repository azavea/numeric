This is a basic demo I've written to show some basic improvements in speed we
can get with a specialized Numeric trait. The file Numeric3.scala contains a
fully specialized trait that already shows significant improvements over
Numeric.

You can run the performance tests with "sbt run"

Limitations:

1. Other packages (Ordering, scala.util.Sorting, etc.) also need specializion
(see the Quicksort performance test and Numeric2 for more information).
Numeric3 does not currently extend Ordering. 

2. The notation for using the specialized Numeric can be annoying.

3. Using an implicit to support infix math operators is nice but currently
seems to impose a serious performance penalty. There have been reports that
escape analysis should be able to detect and optimize this away, but so far
this hasn't worked.
