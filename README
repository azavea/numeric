This is a basic demo I've written to show some basic improvements in speed we
can get with a specialized Numeric trait. The file Numeric3.scala contains a
fully specialized trait that already shows significant improvements over
Numeric.

You can run the performance tests by executing "sbt run"

Limitations:

1. Generic arrays seem to impose a performance penalty in some situations...
fixing that is probably beyond the scope of my (current) ablity. 

2. Other packages (Ordering, scala.util.Sorting, etc.) also need specializion
(see the Quicksort performance test and Numeric2 for more information).

3. The notation for using the specialized Numeric is annoying.

4. Using an implement constructor to build an object that has our Numeric
traits functions defined on it defeats the purpose of using specialization to
avoid boxing/unboxing.
