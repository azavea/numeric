This is a basic demo I've written to show some basic improvements in speed we
can get with a specialized Numeric trait.

You can run the performance tests with "sbt run"

The output shows the speed (in ms) of a direct implementation (without
generics), a new implementation (using my own Numeric) and an old
implementation (using the builtin Numeric).

  n:d is how new compares to direct
  o:d is how old compares to direct
  o:n is how old compares to new

It's worth noting that while very similar my Numeric trait has some differences
from scala.math.Numeric. The most significant ones are:

1. It does not inherit from the Ordering typeclass, but rather directly
implements the comparison methods. I will try to do some cleanup.

2. It does not implement Integral/Fractional. I think that leaving
division/modulo off of Numeric is a mistake, and don't think that
Integral/Fractional is a useful distinction for many kinds of generic math.
